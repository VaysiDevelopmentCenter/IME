# This file makes the 'modules' directory a Python package.

# Optionally, you can make some classes/functions available directly when importing 'modules'
# For example:
# from .engine import MutableEntity, MutationOperator, MutationEngine, NetworkGraph
# from .graph_utils import create_instruction_node, create_label_node

# For now, keeping it simple and requiring explicit sub-module imports.
