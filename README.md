# IME

## Interfunctional Mutation Engine (IME)

The Interfunctional Mutation Engine (IME) is a cutting-edge technology project that leverages mathematical theories, including chaos theory, and philosophical concepts like Bell Superalgebra and Fractal dynamics, to create a mutation engine capable of adapting and evolving. The vision for IME is to serve as a powerful tool for various applications, including the dynamic adaptation and structural reinvention of algorithms and models used in artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, and data science.

IME aims to facilitate **meta-mutations** and **multi-scale evolution**. By utilizing advanced mathematical and conceptual models, the goal is for IME to enable profound architectural transformations and explore infinitely complex search spaces, allowing for rapid exploration and experimentation with novel forms. One potential application area is the development of polymorphic viruses, or imagining an AI language model that dynamically evolves its very architecture and learning paradigms.

This repository serves as the home for the IME project, providing a centralized location for collaboration, documentation, and code. It aims to foster an open and innovative community where researchers, developers, and enthusiasts can contribute to the advancement of mutation engine technology.

## Current Status & Progress

The IME project is under active development, building capabilities incrementally.

**Phase 1: Foundational Mutation Engine (Completed)**

*   **Core Engine Scaffolding:**
    *   `MutableEntity`: A class to wrap data that is targeted for mutation.
    *   `MutationOperator`: An abstract base class defining the interface for all mutation operations.
    *   `MutationEngine`: The main engine class that orchestrates the application of mutation operators to mutable entities.
*   **Basic Mutation Operators:**
    *   `IntegerPerturbationOperator`: Modifies integer values.
    *   `StringReplaceOperator`: Alters string content by character replacement.
    *   `ListElementSwapOperator`: Swaps elements within lists.
*   **Placeholders for Adaptive Behavior:**
    *   The `MutationEngine` includes a basic `mutation_probability` attribute.
    *   A stub `evaluate_entity` method is in place for future fitness/quality assessment.
*   **Example Usage (Phase 1):**
    *   Demonstration script: `examples/simple_mutation_demo.py` (shows basic data type mutations).

**Phase 2: Advanced Concepts - Formalizing Bell Superalgebra and Fractal Mechanisms (Conceptual Framework & Stubs Implemented)**

This phase established the conceptual and structural groundwork for an IME capable of profound architectural and multi-scale mutations, initially targeting neural network representations.

*   **Architectural Graph Representation:**
    *   Defined `ArchitecturalNode`, `ArchitecturalEdge`, and `NetworkGraph` classes. These allow neural networks (and potentially other complex systems) to be represented as flexible, mutable graphs.
    *   `MutableEntity` can now wrap a `NetworkGraph`, making entire architectures subject to mutation.
*   **Structural Partitioning (Bell Superalgebra Inspiration):**
    *   Introduced `PartitionSchema` class to define conceptual groupings or partitions of graph elements (e.g., nodes). This is the first step towards enabling IME to reconfigure system structures in ways inspired by Bell number concepts (exploring different ways a set can be partitioned).
*   **Fractal Mutation Protocol (Conceptual Definition):**
    *   Outlined distinct operational scales for mutation within a `NetworkGraph` (Meta-Parameters, Macro-Architecture, Meso-Architecture, Micro-Architecture).
    *   Defined core principles for applying mutation themes fractally (e.g., Thematic Coherence, Scalable Parameterization, Analogous Operations across scales).
*   **Superalgebraic Reconfiguration Operator (SRO) Stubs:**
    *   `RepartitionGraphOperator`: Conceptual stub for operators that change how a graph's elements are partitioned, creating new `PartitionSchema` objects. (Basic random node partitioning stubbed).
    *   `PartitionBasedRewireOperator`: Conceptual stub for operators that rewire a graph based on an existing `PartitionSchema`. (Basic random inter-partition edge addition stubbed).
*   **Fractal Scale Mutation Operator (FMO) Stubs:**
    *   `HierarchicalNoiseInjectionFMO`: Conceptual stub for applying noise thematically across different structural scales. (Functional micro-scale weight/bias noise injection stubbed).
    *   `SelfSimilarGrowthFMO`: Conceptual stub for growing a graph by replicating structural motifs. (Simplistic motif identification and replication stubbed).
*   **Ontological Evaluation Research (Preliminary):**
    *   Brainstormed potential metrics for evaluating evolving architectures beyond simple task performance, focusing on structural richness, complexity, self-similarity, and evolutionary potential.
*   **Example Usage (Phase 2 Stubs):**
    *   Smoke test script: `examples/advanced_ime_stubs_test.py` (demonstrates instantiation and basic invocation of the new graph structures and SRO/FMO stubs).

**Important Note on SROs/FMOs:** The Superalgebraic and Fractal Scale Mutation Operators are currently **conceptual stubs**. Their `apply` methods contain placeholder logic or highly simplified examples to illustrate their intended purpose. The development of robust algorithms for these advanced operators is a significant ongoing and future task.

Future development will focus on implementing the detailed algorithms for SROs and FMOs, refining the `NetworkGraph` representation, developing sophisticated Ontological Evaluation functions, and further integrating the Bell Superalgebra and Fractal philosophies into the engine's core logic.

### Key Features (Planned)

The IME project is designed with the following key features in mind. The recent architectural groundwork (like `NetworkGraph` and the SRO/FMO concepts) are foundational steps towards realizing these:

-   **Adaptive Mutation Engine:** IME will leverage mathematical models (including chaos theory, Bell Superalgebra, fractal dynamics) to create a mutation engine that adapts and evolves.
-   **Deep Learning Integration & Architectural Evolution:** IME aims to seamlessly integrate with deep learning models, enabling not just parameter tuning but also dynamic evolution and reinvention of their architectures.
-   **Machine Learning Algorithms:** The vision is for IME to incorporate and evolve a wide range of machine learning algorithms.
-   **Polymorphic Virus Development:** IME intends to provide tools and techniques for creating polymorphic viruses.
-   **Community-Driven Innovation:** This project encourages collaboration to advance mutation engine technology.

## IME Algorithm Comes with Super Enhanced Features (Planned)

The long-term vision for the IME algorithm includes these enhanced features. The `NetworkGraph`, `PartitionSchema`, SROs, and FMOs are designed to be enabling technologies for these capabilities, especially for hierarchical and adaptive strategies:

1.  **Adaptive Mutation Rate:** Dynamically adjusted based on performance and ontological metrics.
2.  **Diversity-Driven Mutation Selection:** Employing strategies to explore diverse architectural and parametric spaces.
3.  **Ensemble Evaluation and Selection:** Utilizing multi-objective evaluation, including ontological metrics.
4.  **Knowledge Transfer and Recombination:** Extracting and integrating insights from past successful mutations and architectural patterns.
5.  **Runtime Adaptation to Environment:** Dynamically adjusting mutation strategies and architectural biases.
6.  **Evolutionary Replay and Overfitting Prevention:** Reintroducing successful mutations/architectures to maintain generalizability.
7.  **Hybrid Mutation Operators:** Dynamically selecting from a rich set of operators, including basic, SRO, and FMO types.
8.  **Hierarchical Mutation Strategies:** Explicitly leveraging the multi-scale mutation capabilities defined in the Fractal Mutation Protocol.

The aspiration is for IME to become a powerful technology in the direction of progress and development of new software and intelligent systems.

### Getting Started

To see the **basic mutation capabilities** (Phase 1) of IME in action on simple data types:
```bash
